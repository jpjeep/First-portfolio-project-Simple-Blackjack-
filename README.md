# First-portfolio-project-Simple-Blackjack-
Welcome to my first coding project that will be uploaded to GitHub. I used python to create a simple Blackjack game. 
I did not include all the rules in Blackjack, but the essential ones are included such as drawing playing cards from a standard deck of 52 to form a hand as 
equating as close as possible to 21 but not exceeding it.
